// Code 1 FA_18
// Bryan Ma

// use the foundation of the last code challenge, and instead of drawing 5 ellipses, 
// draw a large number of shapes (ellipses or whatever) using a larger array to store their x positions.
// use map to affect the parameters of them being drawn, like size or color.

// once you've done that, try adding another corresponding array to store their y positions.

// finally, try modifying the values you've stored every frame to make the shapes change their positions somehow.
